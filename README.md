# servicenow-devtraining-welcome
We are so glad you could join us! You are embarking on the journey of a lifetime.

## What's up with this repository? Why do I have it?
We created this repository to make sure you have your GitHub credentials properly configured before you start learning. If you bumped into credential issues later, it would be no fun. The good news is that if you are reading me, all is good! Happy learning and happy creating.

You may delete this repository if you would like, but you harm nothing by keeping it around. (It may come back later if we need to test your credentials again).
